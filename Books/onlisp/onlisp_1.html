This book is intended for anyone who wants to become a better Lisp programmer.
It assumes some familiarity with Lisp, but not necessarily extensive programming
experience. The first few chapters contain a fair amount of review. I hope that
these sections will be interesting to more experienced Lisp programmers as well,
because they present familiar subjects in a new light.
<P>

It's difficult to convey the essence of a programming language in one sentence,
but John Foderaro has come close:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lisp is a programmable programming language.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There is more to Lisp than this, but the ability to bend Lisp to one's will is a
large part of what distinguishes a Lisp expert from a novice. As well as writing
their programs down toward the language, experienced Lisp programmers build
the language up toward their programs. This book teaches how to program in the
bottom-up style for which Lisp is inherently well-suited.

<P>

Bottom-up design is becoming more important as software grows in complexity.
Programs today may have to meet specifications which are extremely complex,
or even open-ended. Under such circumstances, the traditional top-down method
sometimes breaks down. In its place there has evolved a style of programming
quite different from what is currently taught in most computer science courses:
a bottom-up style in which a program is written as a series of layers, each one
acting as a sort of programming language for the one above. X Windows and TeX
are examples of programs written in this style.
<P>

The theme of this book is twofold: that Lisp is a natural language for programs
written in the bottom-up style, and that the bottom-up style is a natural way to
write Lisp programs. On Lisp will thus be of interest to two classes of readers.
For people interested in writing extensible programs, this book will show what
you can do if you have the right language. For Lisp programmers, this book offers
a practical explanation of how to use Lisp to its best advantage.
<P>

The title is intended to stress the importance of bottom-up programming in
Lisp. Instead of just writing your program in Lisp, you can write your own
language on Lisp, and write your program in that.
<P>

It is possible to write programs bottom-up in any language, but Lisp is the
most natural vehicle for this style of programming. In Lisp, bottom-up design is
not a special technique reserved for unusually large or difficult programs. Any
substantial program will be written partly in this style. Lisp was meant from the
start to be an extensible language. The language itself is mostly a collection of
Lisp functions, no different from the ones you define yourself. What's more, Lisp
functions can be expressed as lists, which are Lisp data structures. This means
you can write Lisp functions which generate Lisp code.
<P>

A good Lisp programmer must know how to take advantage of this possibility.
The usual way to do so is by defining a kind of operator called a macro. Mastering
macros is one of the most important steps in moving from writing correct Lisp
programs to writing beautiful ones. Introductory Lisp books have room for no
more than a quick overview of macros: an explanation of what macros are,together
with a few examples which hint at the strange and wonderful things you can do
with them. Those strange and wonderful things will receive special attention here.
One of the aims of this book is to collect in one place all that people have till now
had to learn from experience about macros.
<P>

Understandably, introductory Lisp books do not emphasize the differences
between Lisp and other languages. They have to get their message across to
students who have, for the most part, been schooled to think of programs in Pascal
terms. It would only confuse matters to explain that, while defun looks like a
procedure definition, it is actually a program-writing program that generates code
which builds a functional object and indexes it under the symbol given as the first
argument.
<P>

One of the purposes of this book is to explain what makes Lisp different from
other languages. When I began, I knew that, all other things being equal, I would
much rather write programs in Lisp than in C or Pascal or Fortran. I knew also that
this was not merely a question of taste. But I realized that if I was actually going
to claim that Lisp was in some ways a better language, I had better be prepared to
explain why.
<P>

When someone asked Louis Armstrong what jazz was, he replied "If you have
to ask what jazz is, you'll never know." But he did answer the question in a way:
he showed people what jazz was. That's one way to explain the power of Lisp--to
demonstrate techniques that would be difficult or impossible in other languages.
Most books on programming--even books on Lisp programming--deal with the
kinds of programs you could write in any language. On Lisp deals mostly with
the kinds of programs you could only write in Lisp. Extensibility, bottom-up
programming, interactive development, source code transformation, embedded
languages--this is where Lisp shows to advantage.
<P>

In principle, of course, any Turing-equivalent programming language can do
the same things as any other. But that kind of power is not what programming
languages are about. In principle, anything you can do with a programming
language you can do with a Turing machine; in practice, programming a Turing
machine is not worth the trouble.
<P>

So when I say that this book is about how to do things that are impossible
in other languages, I don't mean "impossible" in the mathematical sense, but in
the sense that matters for programming languages. That is, if you had to write
some of the programs in this book in C, you might as well do it by writing a Lisp
compiler in C first. Embedding Prolog in C, for example--can you imagine the
amount of work that would take? Chapter 24 shows how to do it in 180 lines of
Lisp.
<P>

I hoped to do more than simply demonstrate the power of Lisp, though. I also
wanted to explain why Lisp is different. This turns out to be a subtle question--too
subtle to be answered with phrases like "symbolic computation." What I have
learned so far, I have tried to explain as clearly as I can.

Since functions are the foundation of Lisp programs, the book begins with several chapters on functions. Chapter 2 explains what Lisp functions are and the
possibilities they offer. Chapter 3 then discusses the advantages of functional
programming, the dominant style in Lisp programs. Chapter 4 shows how to use
functions to extend Lisp. Then Chapter 5 suggests the new kinds of abstractions
we can define with functions that return other functions. Finally, Chapter 6 shows
how to use functions in place of traditional data structures.
<P>

The remainder of the book deals more with macros than functions. Macros
receive more attention partly because there is more to say about them, and partly
because they have not till now been adequately described in print. Chapters 7--10
form a complete tutorial on macro technique. By the end of it you will know most
of what an experienced Lisp programmer knows about macros: how they work;
how to define, test, and debug them; when to use macros and when not; the major
types of macros; how to write programs which generate macro expansions; how
macro style differs from Lisp style in general; and how to detect and cure each of
the unique problems that afflict macros.
<P>

Following this tutorial, Chapters 11--18 show some of the powerful abstractions you can build with macros. Chapter 11 shows how to write the classic
macros--those which create context, or implement loops or conditionals. Chapter 12 explains the role of macros in operations on generalized variables. Chapter 13 shows how macros can make programs run faster by shifting computation
to compile-time. Chapter 14 introduces anaphoric macros, which allow you to
use pronouns in your programs. Chapter 15 shows how macros provide a more
convenient interface to the function-builders defined in Chapter 5. Chapter 16
shows how to use macro-defining macros to make Lisp write your programs for
you. Chapter 17 discusses read-macros, and Chapter 18, macros for destructuring.
<P>

With Chapter 19 begins the fourth part of the book, devoted to embedded
languages. Chapter 19 introduces the subject by showing the same program, a
program to answer queries on a database, implemented first by an interpreter
and then as a true embedded language. Chapter 20 shows how to introduce
into Common Lisp programs the notion of a continuation, an object representing
the remainder of a computation. Continuations are a very powerful tool, and
can be used to implement both multiple processes and nondeterministic choice.
Embedding these control structures in Lisp is discussed in Chapters 21 and 22,
respectively. Nondeterminism, which allows you to write programs as if they
had foresight, sounds like an abstraction of unusual power. Chapters 23 and 24
present two embedded languages which show that nondeterminism lives up to its
promise: a complete ATN parser and an embedded Prolog which combined total
about 200 lines of code.
<P>

The fact that these programs are short means nothing in itself. If you resorted to
writing incomprehensible code, there's no telling what you could do in 200 lines.
The point is, these programs are not short because they depend on programming
tricks, but because they're written using Lisp the way it's meant to be used. The
point of Chapters 23 and 24 is not how to implement ATNs in one page of code
or Prolog in two, but to show that these programs, when given their most natural
Lisp implementation, simply are that short. The embedded languages in the latter
chapters provide a proof by example of the twin points with which I began: that
Lisp is a natural language for bottom-up design, and that bottom-up design is a
natural way to use Lisp.
<P>

The book concludes with a discussion of object-oriented programming, and
particularly CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System. By saving this topic till
last, we see more clearly the way in which object-oriented programming is an
extension of ideas already present in Lisp. It is one of the many abstractions that
can be built on Lisp.
<P>

A chapter's worth of notes begins on page 387. The notes contain references,
additional or alternative code, or descriptions of aspects of Lisp not directly related
to the point at hand. Notes are indicated by a small circle in the outside margin,
like this. There is also an Appendix (page 381) on packages.
<P>

Just as a tour of New York could be a tour of most of the world's cultures, a
study of Lisp as the programmable programming language draws in most of Lisp
technique. Most of the techniques described here are generally known in the Lisp
community, but many have not till now been written down anywhere. And some
issues, such as the proper role of macros or the nature of variable capture, are only
vaguely understood even by many experienced Lisp programmers.

Lisp is a family of languages. Since Common Lisp promises to remain a widely
used dialect, most of the examples in this book are in Common Lisp. The language
was originally defined in 1984 by the publication of Guy Steele's Common Lisp:
the Language (CLTL1). This definition was superseded in 1990 by the publication
of the second edition (CLTL2), which will in turn yield place to the forthcoming
ANSI standard.
<P>

This book contains hundreds of examples, ranging from single expressions to
a working Prolog implementation. The code in this book has, wherever possible,
been written to work in any version of Common Lisp. Those few examples which
need features not found in CLTL1 implementations are explicitly identified in the
text. Later chapters contain some examples in Scheme. These too are clearly
identified.

While writing this book I have been particularly thankful for the help of Robert
Morris. I went to him constantly for advice and was always glad I did. Several
of the examples in this book are derived from code he originally wrote, including
the version of for on page 127, the version of aand on page 191, match on
page 239, the breadth-first true-choose on page 304, and the Prolog interpreter
in Section 24.2. In fact, the whole book reflects (sometimes, indeed, transcribes)
conversations I've had with Robert during the past seven years. (Thanks, rtm!)
<P>

I would also like to give special thanks to David Moon, who read large parts
of the manuscript with great care, and gave me very useful comments. Chapter 12
was completely rewritten at his suggestion, and the example of variable capture
on page 119 is one that he provided.
<P>

I was fortunate to have David Touretzky and Skona Brittain as the technical
reviewers for the book. Several sections were added or rewritten at their suggestion. The alternative true nondeterministic choice operator on page 397 is based
on a suggestion by David Toureztky.
<P>

Several other people consented to read all or part of the manuscript, including
Tom Cheatham, Richard Draves (who also rewrote alambda and propmacro
back in 1985), John Foderaro, David Hendler, George Luger, Robert Muller,
Mark Nitzberg, and Guy Steele.
<P>

I'm grateful to Professor Cheatham, and Harvard generally, for providing the
facilities used to write this book. Thanks also to the staff at Aiken Lab, including
Tony Hartman, Janusz Juda, Harry Bochner, and Joanne Klys.
<P>

The people at Prentice Hall did a great job. I feel fortunate to have worked
with Alan Apt, a good editor and a good guy. Thanks also to Mona Pompili,
Shirley Michaels, and Shirley McGuire for their organization and good humor.
<P>

The incomparable Gino Lee of the Bow and Arrow Press, Cambridge, did the
cover. The tree on the cover alludes specifically to the point made on page 27.
<P>

This book was typeset using LaTeX, a language written by Leslie Lamport atop
Donald Knuth's TeX, with additional macros by L. A. Carr, Van Jacobson, and
Guy Steele. The diagrams were done with Idraw, by John Vlissides and Scott
Stanton. The whole was previewed with Ghostview, by Tim Theisen, which is
built on Ghostscript, by L. Peter Deutsch. Gary Bisbee of Chiron Inc. produced
the camera-ready copy.
<P>

I owe thanks to many others, including Paul Becker, Phil Chapnick, Alice
Hartley, Glenn Holloway, Meichun Hsu, Krzysztof Lenk, Arman Maghbouleh,
Howard Mullings, NancyParmet, Robert Penny, Gary Sabot, Patrick Slaney, Steve
Strassman, Dave Watkins, the Weickers, and Bill Woods.
<P>

Most of all, I'd like to thank my parents, for their example and encouragement;
and Jackie, who taught me what I might have learned if I had listened to them.
<P>

I hope reading this book will be fun. Of all the languages I know, I like Lisp
the best, simply because it's the most beautiful. This book is about Lisp at its
lispiest. I had fun writing it, and I hope that comes through in the text.
